To do:

- Dictonary for different types of plants and requirements
- Configure input addresses
- Calculation functions for actuators
- Timer for watering function
- Thresholds for watering

DEMO

Plant profiles:

- Make plant profiles
- Make array of plant profiles and select the index of the "current plant" using the switches

Plant Watering:

- Take "soil moisture reading": From voltage dials maybe?
- Compare to plant profile moisture needs to decide if plant needs to be watered
- If it should be watered, decide how much, calculate duration of water releasing from pump (Light up LED for this time period)
- Print out the current % of moisture on HEX board (before/after watering)

Light:

- LED strength constant calculation based on plant profile
- On a timer
- Display the Hex value or print or something;
- Light up the peripheral LEDs (used in lab3) a value of 0-10 based on the strength of light for certain profile
